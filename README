I am a software developer interested in improving my skills in coding and algorithms everyday. 
This is a collection of problems that I solved while learning STL's in C++. 
This involved using STL containers in the most efficient ways to solve problems. I have also used a few STL algorithms like sort, lower_bound, upper_bound (BS) etc when needed.
I have categorised the problems based on the techniques I used for solving them.
This practice did help me solve complex problems faster and was a good prep for coding interviews.
